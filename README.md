# Confluent for VS Code

The Confluent extension makes it easy for developers to build stream processing applications using
Confluent technology. This extension provides a robust, delightful experience for
[Confluent Cloud](https://confluent.cloud/) products from within the
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) editor desktop environment.

Visit the [Confluent Developer site](https://developer.confluent.io/) for more about developing with
Confluent, and read the docs at the [Confluent documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/) site.

## Features

The Confluent extension for VS Code provides a number of features for working with your Kafka
clusters, topics and schemas.

### Command Palette

Most of the Confluent extension features are available in the VS Code Command Palette. Press
`Cmd+Shift+P`/`Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "confluent" to show the Confluent extension commands.

Some commands are associated with view actions, which are the simple buttons (usually icons) next to
items in the Sidebar. For example, **play** (open Message Viewer and start consuming messages),
**sync** (refresh), and **ellipsis** (extra actions) are all view actions associated with commands
available in the command palette.

### Sidebar

In the Sidebar, click the Confluent logo to open the extension and show the following sections.

#### Connect to your streams

The Confluent extension for VS Code supports accessing your Apache Kafka® clusters locally or on
Confluent Cloud.

- To start a local Kafka cluster,
  [install the Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html) and run
  the
  [`confluent local kafka start` command](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/command-reference/local/kafka/confluent_local_kafka_start.html).
- If you're working on Confluent Cloud, open the Confluent extension and click **Connect to
  Confluent Cloud** or go to the VS Code Accounts menu and click "Sign in with Confluent Cloud to
  use Confluent".

#### Resources

The **Resources** view lists Confluent Cloud environments and associated Kafka and Schema Registry
clusters, as well as local Kafka clusters.

- Click a Kafka cluster to load the topics created in that cluster in the Topics view.
- Click a Schema Registry cluster to load the associated schemas for that registry in the Schemas
  view.

#### Topics

Click the **play** icon next to the topic name to open the **Message Viewer**, which enables
searching and exploring messages in a topic. Within Message Viewer, you can:

- page through and search for specific values within the list of all the messages
- double-click a single message to explore its entire payload encoded into JSON
- pause and resume consuming at any time
- see aggregate counts of messages over time from the histogram view and brush to filter messages by
  timestamp
- toggle partitions on/off to show/hide messages from specific partitions

#### Schemas

The **Schemas** view displays all the schemas available for the current Confluent Cloud
environment's Schema Registry. Schemas are also shown in the **Topics** view by expanding a topic
item if they match the
[`TopicNameStrategy`](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/serdes-develop/index.html#overview)
and the user has the appropriate permissions.

Schema definitions can be viewed by expanding the schema subject to see a specific schema version,
then clicking the **View Schema** icon.

#### Support

The **Support** panel provides links to the extension walkthrough, issue reporting, general
feedback, and options to generate Kafka projects using a template.

## Installation

### From the Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace

In your browser, go to the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) to view,
download, and install the
[Confluent for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=confluentinc.vscode-confluent)
extension.

### From within VS Code

1. Open VS Code.

1. In the VS Code sidebar, click **Extensions** (`Cmd+Shift+X`/`Ctrl+Shift+X`).

1. In the **Extensions** view, search for "Confluent".

1. Click **Install**.

### From a `.vsix` file

_Note: This doc refers to the extension version as `x.x.x`. Ensure you replace this with the actual
version number you want to use, without the `v` prefix._

Confluent provides these VSIX files:

- MacOS with Apple Silicon: `vscode-confluent-darwin-arm64-x.x.x.vsix`
- MacOS with Intel processors: `vscode-confluent-darwin-x64-x.x.x.vsix`
- Linux on ARM-64 processors: `vscode-confluent-linux-arm64-x.x.x.vsix`
- Linux on x86 processors: `vscode-confluent-linux-x64-x.x.x.vsix`

Currently, Windows is not supported, but you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with one of the above Linux .vsix
files.

> The Confluent extension for VS Code is available for Early Access, and some Confluent features may
> not be available. Consider installing the
> [Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html) to access all
> features of Confluent Cloud.

You can install the Confluent extension by using the VS Code UI or by using the
`code --install-extension` command in the terminal.

To install by using the UI, follow these steps:

1. Download the VSIX file appropriate for your machine.

1. Open VS Code, and in the Sidebar, click **Extensions**.

1. At the top of the **Extensions** view, click **...**, and in the context menu, click **Install
   from VSIX…**

1. Navigate to your downloaded `vscode-confluent-vX.X.X.vsix` file and click **Install**.

To install in the terminal, run the following command:

```
code --install-extension /path/to/vscode-confluent-vX.X.X.vsix
```

## Outputs

Once the Confluent extension is activated, you can view extension logs in two separate Output
Channels:

- **Confluent**: logs for the VS Code extension itself
- **Confluent (Sidecar)**: logs from the
  [Sidecar process](https://github.com/confluentinc/ide-sidecar)

## Telemetry

Gathering usage and error data helps Confluent develop a more resilient and user friendly
application. Confluent enables telemetry only in official production releases. Confluent respect
users' preferences for sending telemetry data -- if you have turned off telemetry in your VS Code
settings, the extension doesn't send any events or data.

### Segment for user actions

The extension uses [Segment](https://segment.com/) to log extension usage. See `telemetry.ts` for
implementation and how it is used in the codebase. The extension sends events when you perform major
actions in the extension, such as using any of the registerd commands. This helps Confluent see what
commands are popular and helps to answer other questions about how the extension is used, so
Confluent can make it even more useful.

### Sentry for error tracing

The extension uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to capture and analyze errors, which enables more
robust and friendly error debugging. It is the first item initialized in `extension.ts`, so that it
can send any uncaught exceptions globally, and it's invoked in certain catch blocks to send specific
errors. The [@sentry/rollup-plugin](#) is used to upload source maps.

## Known Limitations

- Confluent Cloud connections require reauthenticating after four hours, and you will be prompted to
  reauthenticate.
- Preview links for non-default organizations work only after switching to the non-default
  organization in the Confluent Cloud UI in your browser.
