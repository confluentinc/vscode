/**
 * Per-extension-instance singleton object for storing basic data to help debug issues, errors, etc.
 * This is created fresh each time the extension is activated, and will grow throughout the course
 * of the extension's lifecycle as actions are taken by the user.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used as a singleton, and should be created once and then updated
 * as needed throughout the extension's lifecycle. Treat all properties as scoped to the lifetime of
 * this extension instance.
 *
 * When dealing with "internal" properties, it is recommended to prefix them with an underscore to
 * indicate that they are not intended to be exported to other formats (e.g. markdown table) but can
 * still be accessed within the codebase as a `public` property. (Example: `_uniqueTopicNames` as an
 * array of unique topic names that we _do not_ want to display in a markdown table, but may use
 * to calculate a `topicCount` property based on `_uniqueTopicNames` that _is_ displayed in a table.)
