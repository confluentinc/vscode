/**
 * Docker Engine API
 * The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker client can do can be done with the API.  Most of the client\'s commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps` is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers, which consists of several API calls.  # Errors  The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:  ``` {   \"message\": \"page not found\" } ```  # Versioning  The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to ensure that clients don\'t break. To lock to a specific version of the API, you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message is returned.  If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.43) is used. For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.43/info`. Using the API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API, so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.  The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer daemons.   # Authentication  Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as `X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5) (JSON) string with the following structure:  ``` {   \"username\": \"string\",   \"password\": \"string\",   \"email\": \"string\",   \"serveraddress\": \"string\" } ```  The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.  If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth), you can just pass this instead of credentials:  ``` {   \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\" } ```

   *
   * `options` is an optional, comma-delimited list of:
   *
   * - `nocopy` disables automatic copying of data from the container
   *   path to the volume. The `nocopy` flag only applies to named volumes.
   * - `[ro|rw]` mounts a volume read-only or read-write, respectively.
   *   If omitted or set to `rw`, volumes are mounted read-write.
   * - `[z|Z]` applies SELinux labels to allow or deny multiple containers
   *   to read and write to the same volume.
   *     - `z`: a _shared_ content label is applied to the content. This
   *       label indicates that multiple containers can share the volume
   *       content, for both reading and writing.
   *     - `Z`: a _private unshared_ label is applied to the content.
   *       This label indicates that only the current container can use
   *       a private volume. Labeling systems such as SELinux require
   *       proper labels to be placed on volume content that is mounted
   *       into a container. Without a label, the security system can
   *       prevent a container's processes from using the content. By

   *   [propagation behavior](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt).
   *   This only applies to bind-mounted volumes, not internal volumes
   *   or named volumes. Mount propagation requires the source mount
   *   point (the location where the source directory is mounted in the
   *   host operating system) to have the correct propagation properties.
   *   For shared volumes, the source mount point must be set to `shared`.
   *   For slave volumes, the mount must be set to either `shared` or
   *   `slave`.
